This is a simple URL Shortener application built using Java. It allows users to shorten long URLs and retrieve the original URLs from shortened versions. The project includes backend logic for shortening URLs, managing them, and querying shortened URLs.

Features
Shortens long URLs to a shorter, more manageable format.
Provides a unique short link for each URL.
Retrieves the original URL from the shortened version.
Simple Java-based backend logic.
Can be extended with a front-end interface.
Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following:

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or higher installed.
An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortener-java.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd url-shortener-java
Compile the Java files:

bash
Copy
javac URLShortener.java
Run the application:

bash
Copy
java URLShortener
How It Works
Shortening a URL:

The program generates a unique hash or ID for the provided URL.
The original URL is stored with the shortened version in a local database (could be a file or an in-memory database).
Retrieving the original URL:

The user can input the shortened URL, and the program will retrieve the corresponding original URL.
Example Usage
Shortening a URL:

java
Copy
URLShortener.short("https://www.example.com")
Retrieving the original URL:

java
Copy
URLShortener.retrieve("abc123")
API (Optional)
If you want to create a REST API for this project, you can use Java frameworks like Spring Boot. Hereâ€™s a sample endpoint structure:

POST /shorten - Shortens a URL.
GET /retrieve/{shortUrl} - Retrieves the original URL from the shortened version.
Testing
For unit tests, you can use JUnit for testing the functionality of URL shortening and retrieval.
Ensure all critical functions (e.g., URL validation, shortening logic) are well-tested.
